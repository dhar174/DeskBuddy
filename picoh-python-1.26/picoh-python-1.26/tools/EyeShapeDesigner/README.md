* Tested on Python 3.7.  on macOS and Windows 10 and Python 3.4 on Raspberry Pi.

How to run
----------
1) Right click and save in your working directory: [EyeShapeDesigner.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohbot/picoh-python/master/tools/EyeShapeDesigner/EyeShapeDesigner.py)  

2) Plug in Picoh (Optional, connect Picoh to preview your drawings on the matrix display) 

3) Run in IDLE or a Python editor/launcher of your choice. 

Features
----------
* Draw, modify, rename and delete eyeshapes.

* See your drawing on Picoh's matrix in real time. 

* Enable and disable an eyeshape's auto mirror setting.

* Animate Picoh's pupil using your mouse position to help test your eye shape. 

* Test the blink animation you have draw using a button click. 

Using Eye Shapes
----------
The Eye Shape Designer will read and write eyeshapes from the Ohbot.obe file found within the picohData folder in your working directory.

If you want to use a shape you have designed in a program for example:

<a href="https://github.com/ohbot/picoh-python/blob/master/.images/TestEyeShape.png?raw=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/ohbot/picoh-python/blob/master/.images/TestEyeShape.png?raw=true" border="0" width = "100%"/></a>

You can use the setEyeShape command. 

```python

picoh.setEyeShape("TestEyeShape")

```
or set the left and right eye to different shapes. 

```python

picoh.setEyeShape("TestEyeShapeOne","TestEyeShapeTwo")

```
Please ensure you save your program inside the same folder as the eye shape designer so they can both access the same copy of the picohData folder. See the picohData Folder section in the main [README](https://github.com/ohbot/picoh-python/blob/master/README.md) for more information.


Auto Mirror
----------

Many eye shapes work well when the left eye is a mirror of the right eye, check the automirror box in the eye shape designer to toggle this setting for your eye shapes. For shapes where automirror is turned on, the image in the right eye will be mirrored automatically.

Picoh Button
----------

Toggle the Picoh button to disable/enable Picoh previewing your drawing on its display.
